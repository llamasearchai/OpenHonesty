# Release Notes

## Version 0.1.0 - Initial Release

**Release Date**: January 2025

### Overview

The Model Honesty Research Platform v0.1.0 is the initial release of a comprehensive command-line platform for evaluating and improving the truthfulness and honesty of language models.

### New Features

#### Command-Line Interface
- Complete CLI with `honesty` command and subcommands
- `evaluate` - Model honesty evaluation with truthfulness and hallucination detection
- `train` - Model training with reward models and RLHF support
- `benchmark` - Multi-model comparison and ranking system
- `dataset` - Dataset management with create, validate, and stats operations
- `server` - REST API server for programmatic access

#### Evaluation Capabilities
- Truthfulness evaluation for factual accuracy assessment
- Hallucination detection to identify fabricated information
- Support for multiple evaluation metrics and scoring systems
- Batch processing for efficient large-scale evaluation

#### Training Systems
- Reward model training for honesty optimization
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) implementation
- Configurable training parameters and optimization strategies
- Model saving and loading functionality

#### Dataset Management
- Support for JSONL, JSON, and CSV data formats
- Dataset validation and quality checks
- Statistical analysis and reporting
- Data curation and preprocessing utilities

#### Benchmarking Framework
- Multi-model comparison system
- Ranking and scoring algorithms
- Export capabilities for results analysis
- Comprehensive metrics reporting

#### API and Integration
- REST API server with FastAPI
- Docker deployment support
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Environment variable configuration

### Technical Specifications

#### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management

cd OpenHonesty
docker-compose up -d
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Evaluation
```bash
honesty evaluate --model gpt2 --dataset truthfulqa.jsonl --type truthfulness
```

#### Model Training
```bash
honesty train --model gpt2 --dataset training_data.jsonl --method reward_model
```

#### Benchmarking
```bash
honesty benchmark --models gpt2,bert-base --dataset benchmark_data.jsonl
```
